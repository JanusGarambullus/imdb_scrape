# Scraping IMDB Using Rvest

Disclaimer: IMDB changed their web layout, which means only 250 films can be viewed in a single window, therefore,
the script no longer works.

IMDB has some really nicely scrapable pages such as 
https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=feature&sort=num_votes,desc

You can set the number of results to be up to 10000 titles, which enables us to scrape them all in one go without having to loop over thousands of pages. This project shows how you can scrape most of the info found on the page on the 10000 most voted titles. The code is found in the "notebook.Rmd file".
